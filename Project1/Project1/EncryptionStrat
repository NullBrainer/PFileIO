1) Create an encoding matrix
2) Multiply encoding matrix by another matrix composed of character values to get the encrypted matrix
3) Find the inverse of the encoding matrix to decrypt the encrypted matrix
    a) Find the determinant of the encoding matrix
    b) Transpose the encoding matrix
    c) Find the adjugate matrix from the transposed matrix
    d) Divide each number in the adjugate matrix by the determinant to find the inverse of the encoding matrix (decoding matrix)
4) Turn the encrypted matrix into bytes
5) Choose a position and insert those bytes at that position
6) The key will consist of the sequence of positions we inserted at, and the number of bytes inserted at that location
